# DOSATO

## Welcome!

This is the official repo for the Dosato programming language, this interpreter is entirely written in C by me.<br>
Right now it's in a semi-done state, most features I wanted to implement are already implemented, but there are still some things to do.<br>
In the meantime, this is a fully functional, more then capable programming language, and I'm proud of it.

## What is Dosato?

Dosato is a programming language that I made for fun, It's syntax is inspired by C, VB and even some Python.<br>
But really, It's syntax is pretty unique and it's hard to compare it to other languages.<br><br>
Dosato aims to be a simple language, giving you the convenience of a high level language like python, but still having static types and more.<br>
I see it as my own take on a new programming language, and I'm pretty happy with the result.

## How do I use it?

Dosato is an interpreted language, so you can just run the interpreter and pass it a file to run.<br>
It's easy to use and get going, and the interpreter is pretty tiny, so you can just download it and run it (no additional bloat).<br>

## How do I install it?

You can download the latest release from the releases page, or you can compile it yourself.<br>
To compile it yourself, you need to have a C compiler installed. Common ones that are proved to work are gcc and clang, provided you compile with a version supporting C20 features.<br>
You can run `gcc -o dosato dosato.c` to compile it with gcc, or `clang -o dosato dosato.c` to compile it with clang.<br>
If you want to compile it with a different compiler, you can do so, but you might need to change the code a bit to make it work.<br>

## How do I run it?

You can run it by passing it a file to run, like this: `dosato file.to`.<br>
The official file extension for Dosato is `.to`, but you can use whatever you want.<br>

## Where can I learn this language?

I have build a downloadable documentation for Dosato, you can download it [here](https://github.com/Robotnik08/Dosato-docs).
